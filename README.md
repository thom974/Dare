# Welcome to Dare!

Dare! is a social media app enabling users to seek discomfort. The main feature is a real-time feed where users can post challenges for other users to complete. Dare! is currently in-progress.

## Technologies

Dare! was created with **Kotlin** using **Ktor** for creating a server supporting **WebSockets** connections. **Firebase** was used for storing user data (**Cloud Firestore**) and user-uploaded images (**Cloud Storage**). User authentication is handled by **Firebase Authentication**. For the UI **Jetpack Compose** was used.
